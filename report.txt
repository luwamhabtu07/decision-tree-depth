-----------------------------
Problem Overview:
-----------------------------
We are calculating the maximum depth of a binary tree that represents a decision support system for financial product recommendations. Each node is a question, and each branch represents a Yes/No response.

-----------------------------
Solution Approach:
-----------------------------
We use a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to calculate the depth.

Function:
- max_depth(root)
    - If the root is None, return 0
    - Recursively calculate the max depth of left and right subtrees
    - Return 1 + the maximum of the two

-----------------------------
Time Complexity:
-----------------------------
O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- Every node is visited exactly once.

-----------------------------
Space Complexity:
-----------------------------
O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
- Due to the recursion call stack.
- Best case (balanced tree): O(log n)
- Worst case (skewed tree): O(n)

-----------------------------
Optimizations:
-----------------------------
The current recursive DFS solution is optimal in both time and space for this problem. 
An iterative version using a queue (Breadth-First Search) would offer the same time complexity but could be more memory intensive for wide trees.

-----------------------------
Trade-offs:
-----------------------------
Recursive DFS is easier to implement and more readable, but deep trees could hit recursion limits. 
An iterative approach avoids recursion depth issues but is slightly more complex to implement.
