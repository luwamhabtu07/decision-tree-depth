# Decision Tree Depth Calculator

This project determines the maximum depth of a binary tree representing a decision support system for financial products.

## Files
- `max_depth.py`: Contains the `TreeNode` class and the `max_depth` function.
- `test_max_depth.py`: Unit tests for normal and edge cases.
- `diagram.png`: Visual diagram of the binary tree.
- `report.txt`: Time/space complexity analysis and optimization notes.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run tests:

```bash
python3 test_max_depth.py
